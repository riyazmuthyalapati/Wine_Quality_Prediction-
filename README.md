Wine quality prediction by using machine learning

About wine:

Wine is a beverage made from fermented grape and other fruit juices with lower amount of alcohol content.
Quality of wine is graded based on the taste of wine & vintage. This process is time taking, costly & not efficient
A wine itself includes different parameters like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free Sulphur dioxide, total Sulphur dioxide, density, pH, Sulphates, alcohol and quality.

Problem Statement:

In industries, understanding the demands of wine safety testing can be a complex task for the laboratory with numerous analytes and residues to monitor.
But our applicationâ€™s prediction, provide ideal solutions for the analysis of wine, which will make this whole process efficient and cheaper with less human interaction.
